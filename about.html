      <p>
        AC Manufacturing Solutions was created to help small and mid-size manufacturers
        stabilize their processes and improve throughput without relying on vague improvement
        initiatives or long consulting engagements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus is practical and execution-driven. Work starts on the shop floor by
        understanding how processes actually run, where variation enters the system,
        and what constraints limit output.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engagements are scoped, outcome-focused, and designed to leave teams with
        clear documentation, standard work, and decision-ready processes they can maintain.
